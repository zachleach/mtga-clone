what am i trying to do here


#	step 1: understanding requirements
output requirements:
explain how the current system works at a high-level in terms of control flow
explain the expected behavior of the system after implementing the feature request above

#	step 2: drafting solutions
output requirements:
consider the different ways to implement this feature given the underlying programming style and design from the source files
for each approach, explain the pros and cons in terms of maintainability
summarize most recommended approach and whether it's likely too complicated to simply extend the application to implement it


#	step 3: simple implementation approach
output requirements:
break down (solution X) into a step-by-step implementation approach 
for each step, briefly explain how you will approach implementing it in order to prioritize simplicity, readability, and maintainability
