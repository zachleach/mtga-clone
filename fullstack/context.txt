context:
i'm unfamiliar with web development terminology
i'm trying to learn how websockets and endpoints work

tech stack:
the frontend is in react
the backend is in python using fast api 

output requirements:
do not use any css, only bare html elements to illustrate core functionality
do not add more functionality than what is specified by the user
use two space indentation for javascript files
the fastapi server should have hot reloading (e.g., if __name__ == "__main__": uvicorn.run("main:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, reload=True)
