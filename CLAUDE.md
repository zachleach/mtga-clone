# Git Commit Message Style
Always use this format for commit messages:
<concise justification>; therefore, <high-level change summary>

Keep both parts brief and focused on the essential "why" and "what".

Examples:
- "JSON persistence in Worlds.java is unreliable for chunk claims; therefore, migrate to SQLite with immediate
writes via Data.Chunks"
- "HashMap intermediaries in Data.Experience add unnecessary complexity; therefore, remove them and read/write
player data directly via Player API"
- "Server roadmap needs documentation; therefore, update todo.txt with feature plans"
