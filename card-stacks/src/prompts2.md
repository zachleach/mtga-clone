before responding to the following query, outline the task and its assumptions step-by-step

extend the cardhand component to add the following drag and drop functionality 
the container where the cards in the cardhand resides is a drop zone
dropping cards onto that drop zone causes the cards to be inserted into the hand
the position to insert the card into is the closest card (horizontally) to where the mouse dropped the card

interesting, it didn't use the structural pattern 



how can you structure your proposed changes to maintain consistency with similar features in the codebase
how would your proposed changes interact with the rest of the system

feature request:
i'd like to be able to layout board components in App.jsx similar to how boards are layed out in Previous.jsx
a top row consisting of board objects in a row, rotated 180 degrees, taking up 40% of the viewport height
a bottom row consisting of a board object taking 60% of the viewport height
